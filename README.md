# 🚀 VR Space Scraper

Hey there!  
Welcome to **VR Space Scraper**, a quirky, beginner-friendly VR game I built while learning the basics of VR development. This was my first dive into creating something in Unity for VR, and it turned out to be both a space adventure and a massive learning journey. 🌌

## 🌟 About the Game  
 
You're stuck in a void of space (yep, bad luck). You're low on food, surrounded by random space junk, and trying to keep yourself alive long enough to figure a way out. From throwing scrap into a black hole to analyzing anomalies for energy to get back to earth.

## 🛠️ What I Learned  

Building this game taught me a bunch of VR development basics, like:  
- Custom hand grabbing mechanics 🖐️  
- Object snapping ✨  
- Interactive button levers and wheel mechanics 🔄  
- Smooth continuous movement 🚶‍♂️  
- Teleportation and climbing mechanics 🧗‍♂️  

It might not be perfect, but it’s a game that actually works on any VR headset! I tested it on my **Oculus Quest 2** and had a blast watching it come to life.
